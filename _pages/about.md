Hello! I am Abdulaziz Alghamdi, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida, working under the mentorship of Prof. David Mohaisen. My research focuses on advancing security and privacy in emerging technologies, with a particular emphasis on AR/VR systems, Android applications, and IoT ecosystems. I specialize in applying machine learning, reverse engineering, and large language models (LLMs) to identify vulnerabilities and enhance the robustness of digital systems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as a Lecturer at Najran University, where I contribute to shaping the next generation of engineers. Beyond research, I am deeply passionate about translating theoretical advancements into practical solutions that address real-world security challenges. I am always excited to engage in innovative collaborations and contribute to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity and machine learning.
