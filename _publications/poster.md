A proliferation of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies has introduced complex security and performance challenges exacerbated by the absence of comprehensive benchmark datasets. Due to this gap, performing a practical analysis and developing robust security measures for AR/VR applications is challenging. As AR and VR technologies continue to spread across various sectors, there is a pressing need for datasets that provide extensive insights into application behaviors and vulnerabilities. Current datasets are insufficient, limiting security and performance evaluations.

To address these challenges, we have developed xr-droid, a benchmark dataset comprising 408 diverse AR/VR applications collected from the Google Play Store. The dataset includes a rich array of data modalities such as control flow graphs, strings, permissions, API calls, hexdump, and metadata, enabling comprehensive security and performance studies. Our dataset analysis revealed prevalent security risks and potential privacy breaches across multiple applications. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not properly addressed. Additionally, xr-droid facilitates a deeper understanding of AR/VR applicationsâ€™ behavior under various conditions, supporting the development of enhanced security protocols.

In addition to filling an urgent need for specialized datasets in the area of AR/VR, xr-droid also provides a platform for future research targeting improved security and efficiency of AR/VR applications. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of common vulnerabilities and behavior patterns provided by xr-droid assists researchers and developers in building safer and more reliable AR/VR environments.
