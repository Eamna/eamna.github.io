The development of metaverses and virtual worlds on various platforms, including mobile devices, has led to the growth of applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in recent years. This application growth is paralleled by a growth of interest in analyzing and understanding AR/VR applications from security and performance standpoints. Despite this growing interest, benchmark datasets are lacking to facilitate this research pursuit. In this paper, we collect a dataset that consists of 408 diverse AR/VR applications from the Google Play Store and acquire various data modalities associated with those applications standardized in the form of seven features: control flow graphs, strings, functions, permissions, API calls, hexdump, and metadata. We highlight various research endeavors (applications) that can benefit from our dataset for each data modality.
