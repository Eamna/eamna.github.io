This paper comprehensively analyzes privacy policies in AR/VR applications, leveraging BERT, a state-of-the-art text classification model, to evaluate the clarity and thoroughness of these policies. By comparing the privacy policies of AR/VR applications with those of free and premium websites, this study provides a broad perspective on the current state of privacy practices within the AR/VR industry. Our findings indicate that AR/VR applications generally offer a higher percentage of positive segments than free content but lower than premium websites. The analysis of highlighted segments and words revealed that AR/VR applications strategically emphasize critical privacy practices and key terms. This enhances privacy policies' clarity and effectiveness.
