This presentation delves into the privacy policies of 408 Android AR/VR applications, highlighting the challenges posed by the immersive and interactive nature of AR/VR technologies. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, including BERT, the study classifies privacy policy segments into nine categories, emphasizing key privacy terms and practices. The findings reveal that while AR/VR applications demonstrate stronger privacy transparency compared to free content websites, they still lag behind premium platforms. Recommendations include enhancing privacy policy clarity and developing automated tools for continuous evaluation.
